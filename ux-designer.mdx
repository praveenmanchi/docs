# Product Design Playbook

At the start of 2021, Dialpad’s core product was a business phone platform. We supported several use cases, but making and receiving phone calls over the internet was our bread and butter. By the end of the year, however, we acquired two companies and pledged to add email, chat, and social to our product. I was tasked to lead design for a project that would double the size of the product.

(cracks knuckles) Alright, I’m an experienced designer. I can figure out how to get this done.

I quickly discovered this was a hard statement to deliver on.

Product designers have never had so many tools and techniques at our disposal to help us do our job. Research, journey maps, Figma, code, Keynote, data analysis… the list is huge and keeps growing. With so many options, how do we know which ones to use for our projects and when?

And let’s be honest, how do we avoid doing this?

A bunch of police cars labeled with UX and discovery terms chasing a white SUV labeled ‘Me, jumping straight into hi-fidelity designs’. We’ve all been guilty at one time or another. [Source](link-to-source-if-applicable)

Some teams have distilled their product design process into a diagram or chart. At Dialpad, we adapted the double-diamond product design process into a triple diamond (influenced by Zendesk). Ours looks something like this:

Graphics like this look great in a blog post, but how often are they actually referenced? That works most of the time. Though in reality, sometimes my process looks more like this:

So it goes 🙃

## What's Your Product Design Process?

What do I say when someone asks me that dreaded question?

“What’s your product design process?”

I’ve picked up a bunch of tools and activities in my years as a product designer, but until recently, had never documented them. As a result, I occasionally forgot parts of the process, and my designs suffered as a result.

To fix this, I wrote down each part of my process so I’d have a playbook to refer to in the future. This is that playbook.

I think about my design process not as a mandatory set of actions for every project, but rather a reference and a prompt I can use to either do a task or understand why it can be skipped. Like a carpenter’s toolbox, it’s helpful to remember what tools are available, and how and when they’re helpful.

## Discovery

Not having a clearly defined problem or goal can lead to hundreds of lost hours and resources because of misaligned expectations, incorrect project scoping, or unforeseen problems. While a team may feel they know these answers and so want to skip right to building something, it’s important to align and validate assumptions first so the project is set up for future success.

The goal of this phase is to help identify a problem statement, frame the problem, and gather enough evidence so we can confidently move forward into the ideation phase.

### Potential activities: (choose which ones make sense for each project)

- Make observations: What do we see? What do we know so far? This deepens our knowledge of the project and saves us from doing repeat discovery. Helpful when starting a Product Requirements Doc (PRD) or design doc. 🕓 2–3 days
- Proto-Personas: A combination of research and intuition that represent what we think our users are like. Helpful when people disagree on who our users are or what their needs are. 🕓 1–2 days
- Journey mapping: A visualization of the process someone goes through to complete a goal. Helpful when you want a big picture understanding of the user’s experience. This may include off-site things like user emotions or external touch points. 🕓 1 week. [Example](link-to-example)
- Service blueprint: Map out the environment that will be affected by a project, including how different parts of the environment interact with each other. Good for large projects that might impact many parts of a system. Service blueprints also help break down a project into manageable chunks and milestones. 🕓 1 week. [Example](link-to-example)
- Contextual inquiry: Understand how folks use your product and why they do what they do. [Example](link-to-example)
- Generative research: Understand users’ motivations, pain points, behaviors. Five Whys is helpful in going beyond surface-level assumptions and uncovering root causes of a problem. 🕓 1–2 weeks (per round of research). [Example](link-to-example)
- Task analysis: Map out the steps someone takes to complete a task, so you can add or remove steps to improve the process. [Example](link-to-example)
- UX tear downs: Learn from established or related patterns, especially when those patterns are easily accessible (generally harder for paid products). 🕓 1–2 days
- Stakeholder / SME interviews: Understand what we already know and/or have tried. Target folks with historical context of the problem. 🕓 1 week
- Data analysis: Answer questions about “how many” and “how often”. Get access to analytics and ask someone in Product Analytics to pull data. 🕓 1–2 days
- UX canvas: Show the team “why” they’re doing the current work, exposing gaps in the problem statement and solutions, and shifting the conversation from outputs to outcomes. 🕓 1–2 days. [Example](link-to-example)

### Exit Criteria

- Problem statement: 1–3 sentences describing the user, their goal, and desired outcome supported by data.
- A clear, achievable goal: Outline of expected change(s) and how it ties back into specific product and/or business KPIs.
- Success criteria: Select measurable criteria that will be used to determine if the solution is solving the problem.
- Potential concerns, risks, or sticky areas of the project

These should all be captured in a PRD or functional spec that the team will evolve throughout the project.

## Definition

By defining a problem, stating a goal, and articulating success metrics, the team has helped define some guardrails to design within. Time in this phase can vary depending on the problem and how strongly the team feels about the solution.

### Potential activities:

- Break down the project: Organize the project into manageable chunks and milestones, assign responsibilities, and delegate appropriately. Estimate each phase so the work can be coordinated with other activities and teams. Helpful with large projects that impact multiple product areas. 🕓 2–3 days
- Problem prioritization: Make an Impact / Effort matrix for problems and workflows. Helps sequence potential solutions. 🕓 1 day
- Design sprint: An all-hands on deck design activity that designs or redesigns a product. Helpful when a quick solution is required, the challenge is big and complex, or the team is stuck. 🕓 5 days (per sprint)
- Design workshop: Quickly generate competing ideas for a specific problem or point in the UX. Crazy 8’s, card sorting, etc. Helpful with abstract problems that could be solved in numerous ways. 🕓 1 day (per workshop)
- Rolling research
